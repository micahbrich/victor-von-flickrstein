    #
    # == Accessors
    # 
    # This class maps directly onto the flickr.people.* API methods and provides the following attributes
    # for a user:
    #
    # [id] The ID for this user (also referred to as the NSID in the API docs)
    # [username] This user's username
    # [name] This user's full name (if entered)
    # [location] This user's location (if entered)
    # [photos_url] The direct URL to this user's photostream
    # [profile_url] The direct URL to this user's profile
    # [photos_count] The number of photos that this user has uploaded
    # [icon_url] This user's buddy icon (or a default one if an icon wasn't uploaded)
    # [pro?] Does this user have a pro account?
    # [admin?] Is this user an admin?
    #
    # == Associations
    #
    # The User class is pretty central to many of the other data available across the system, so there are a
    # few associations available to a user:
    # 
    # [sets] A list of this user's public sets (newest first). See Fleakr::Objects::Set for more information.
    # [groups] A list of this user's public groups. See Fleakr::Objects::Group.
    # [photos] A list of this user's public photos (newest first).  See Fleakr::Objects::Photo.
    # [contacts] A list of this user's contacts - these are simply User objects
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    # Access to a specific user is typically done through the Fleakr.user method:
    #
    #  user = Fleakr.user('brownout')
    #  user.id
    #  user.username
    #  user.sets
    #  user.contacts
    #
