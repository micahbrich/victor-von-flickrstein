    # = Image
    #
    # This class wraps the functionality for saving remote images to disk. It's called
    # by the Fleakr::Objects::Photo class to save an image with a specific size and would 
    # typically never be called directly.
    # 
    # Example:
    # 
    #  user = Fleakr.user('brownout')
    #  user.photos.first.small.save_to('/tmp')
    #
    # == Attributes
    # 
    # [size] The name of this image's size (e.g. Square, Large, etc...)
    # [width] The width of this image
    # [height] The height of this image
    # [url] The direct URL for this image
    # [page] The page on Flickr that represents this photo
    #
